In the early stages of my journey as a Junior Web Developer, I created the "Embassy" project, a website reflecting an online reservation system for luxury rooms. I utilized fundamental technologies such as HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to design a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface. This experience helped me become familiar with the basic principles of frontend development and enhance my skills in the field. It serves as an example of my commitment to evolving and delivering functional solutions through programming for the front-end part!!!
